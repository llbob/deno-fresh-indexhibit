## Notes:

- This is a work in progress.
- I'm aware that the styling is a bit all over the place. Initially i wanted to avoid twind, but then i sadly took a liking to it while this project was on pause. 
- The project data is in the /routes/data folder - this to make it simple for outsiders to change the content - cms incoming?
